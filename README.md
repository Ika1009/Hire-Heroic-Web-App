# 💼 HireHeroic – Full-Stack Job Aggregator Platform

![HireHeroic Logo](./images/UltraCV.png)

**HireHeroic** is a professional-grade job aggregator web application developed as a Fiverr project. I was responsible for **the entire product lifecycle** — from UI/UX design to full backend development — delivering a scalable and visually appealing platform for real-time job discovery.

## 🔧 About the Project

This platform was commissioned by a Fiverr client who needed a fully functional job board with real-time data and user-centric design. I designed and built both the front-end and back-end, ensuring fast performance, responsive design, and a smooth user experience.

Job listings are sourced via **integrated third-party job APIs**, giving users access to thousands of up-to-date listings from multiple providers. The application also supports job search filters, saved listings, and an intuitive tracking system for applicants.
